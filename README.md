# Team13-back (4berry App)
### Looking forward to write a story? How about drawing ideas? Is storytelling your passion? Would you like others to see, comment and collaborate in your work? Are quests and challenges your favorite ways to practice your creative abilities? There are thousands of designers, artists, writers and creative wizkids looking for ways to bring their ideas to life using storyboards. Therefore, we present you 4berry!

Soon you'll get to know about 4berry, a web app that will allow users to create, comment, collaborate, and compete in storyboard-making. For the time present, this repository holds the backend of the application, storing a RESTful API with the help of technologies such as Node js and Express. The API resources that you can find in this repository are: achievements, cards, chats, chat messages, comments, games, game types, storyboards and users; all of which have the 4 basic HTTP methods implemented (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).
